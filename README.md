/**
 * Sol III - In glorious WebGL Form
 *
 * tl;dr A game where you play as a Spaceship who must avoid Blobs and Shots
 *
 * History that is only of significance to the author:
 * Sol III was the only game I ever actually completed using Gamemaker 6.1
 * After the immense... [lack of] popularity... of Humphrey The Rabbit, I decided to try porting Sol III to WebGL (ok, canvas2d if you don't have webgl)
 * 
 * One day it'll probably get rewritten in C++ where it belongs.
